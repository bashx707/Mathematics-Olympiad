\section{Disclaimer}
\alert{This document is not official guidance},
but an  approximation based upon one person's experience.
There is no promise that the Indian Mathematics Olympiads, will follow this syllabus.
Manier times there may appear problems which may demand more knowledge.
In addition, the content of these exams changes over time as well albeit gradually and in ways such that it is easily predictable.
This list is \emph{not} intended to be an exhaustive enumeration;
it highlights guidelines for the ``most common cases''
and is deliberately ambiguous about certain topics.
\section{Introduction}
Each topic is classified into one of the following categories.
\begin{description}
  \ii[\isRq\ Required]
  Topics in this category are prerequisite knowledge for solutions,
  and all contestants are expected to know them.

  \ii[\isUs\ Useful for solution]
  Topics in this category are often useful in solutions
  and contestants are encouraged to be familiar with this topic.
  However, when a solution is related to this topic,
  often there is a different solution using only ``required'' knowledge,
  or else the solution would be reasonable even to non-experts.
  Terms from these topics will typically not appear
  in problem statements without definition.
  Therefore, these topics are less important than topics marked as ``required''.

  \ii[\isAv\ Advanced topic]
  Topics in this area may be helpful (or occasionally even necessary)
  in more difficult problems on the INMO.
  However, beginners should prioritize learning
  other topics before these ones.
  Concepts from this area will typically not appear in
  problem statements without definition.
\end{description}

\section{General}

In general, not much knowledge is demanded of contestants.
Problem statements are largely meant to be understandable even to those
without much formal training.
Topics usually covered in advanced undergraduate studies are often excluded.
Rather, the problems are somewhat meant to
test ingenuity and intuition rather than mere knowledge,
and often demand simple tools to be used in unexpected ways.

All students are expected to be fluent with mathematical proofs especially for INMO.
